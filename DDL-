SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) interview questions and explanations:- 
_______________________________________________________
1. What is DDL? List some common DDL commands.

    DDL stands for Data Definition Language, used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects. Common DDL commands are:
    CREATE: To create new tables, views, indexes, etc.
  
    ALTER: To modify existing database structures, such as adding columns to a table.
    DROP: To delete objects, like tables or indexes.
    TRUNCATE: To quickly remove all records from a table without logging each row deletion.
    RENAME: To rename a database object, such as a table or column.

2. Explain the purpose and usage of the CREATE TABLE statement.
    The CREATE TABLE statement is used to define a new table in a database.
    It specifies the table name, column names, data types, and constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key, not null).
    Example: -
    CREATE TABLE employees (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50), 
      salary DECIMAL(10,2)
    );

    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50),
        BirthDate DATE
    );

3. What are constraints? Name a few and explain their usage.
    Constraints enforce rules on data in a table. Some common constraints are:
    PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record.
    FOREIGN KEY: Enforces a relationship between two tables.
    UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
    CHECK: Restricts values based on a condition.
    NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

4. What is the difference between ALTER TABLE and DROP TABLE statements?
    ALTER TABLE is used to modify the structure of an existing table, such as adding/removing columns, modifying data types, or adding/removing constraints.
    DROP TABLE is used to completely remove a table and its data from the database.
    Example ALTER TABLE: ALTER TABLE employees ADD email VARCHAR(50);
    Example DROP TABLE: DROP TABLE employees;

5. Explain the purpose and usage of the TRUNCATE TABLE statement.
    TRUNCATE TABLE is used to quickly remove all rows from a table, while preserving the table structure.
    It is faster than using a DELETE statement without a WHERE clause, as TRUNCATE does not generate transaction logs.
    Example: TRUNCATE TABLE orders;

6. What is the difference between DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE?
    DROP TABLE removes the table definition and all its data from the database.
    TRUNCATE TABLE removes all the data from the table, but the table structure (columns, constraints, etc.) remains.
    DROP TABLE is a DDL operation, while TRUNCATE TABLE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation.
    DROP TABLE is irreversible, while TRUNCATE TABLE can be rolled back within a transaction.

7. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
    DELETE: Deletes specific rows from a table. It can be rolled back and generates a log.
    TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table without logging each row, so it’s faster but cannot be rolled back.
    DROP: Deletes an entire database object (like a table), along with its structure. It is also non-reversible.

8. Explain the purpose and usage of the RENAME TABLE statement.
    RENAME TABLE is used to change the name of an existing table in the database.
    Example: RENAME TABLE old_employees TO new_employees;

9. What is the difference between ADD COLUMN and ALTER COLUMN in the ALTER TABLE statement?
    ADD COLUMN is used to add a new column to an existing table.
    ALTER COLUMN is used to modify the definition of an existing column, such as changing the data type or column constraints.
    Example ADD COLUMN: ALTER TABLE employees ADD email VARCHAR(50);
    Example ALTER COLUMN: ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY salary DECIMAL(12,2);

10. Explain the CREATE INDEX command and its use.
         The CREATE INDEX command creates an index on a table to speed up data retrieval. For example:
         CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);

11. Explain the purpose and usage of the CREATE VIEW statement.
    CREATE VIEW is used to define a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.
    Views provide a way to encapsulate complex queries and present them as a simple table.
    Example: CREATE VIEW high_salaries AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 80000;

12. What is the purpose of the IF EXISTS or IF NOT EXISTS clause in DDL statements?
    These clauses are used to conditionally create, alter, or drop database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes).
    They help prevent errors when the object already exists (or doesn't exist) and allow for more robust and flexible database management.
    Example: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS old_table;

13. How can you add a primary key to an existing table?
    Eg.. ALTER TABLE Employees
    ADD CONSTRAINT PK_EmployeeID PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID);

14.How can you delete a column from an existing table?
    Eg.. ALTER TABLE Employees
    DROP COLUMN Salary;

15. What is the difference between the primary key and unique constraints?
    A primary key uniquely identifies each row and doesn’t allow NULL values. A unique constraint also enforces uniqueness but allows one NULL value.

16. Can DDL commands be rolled back? Explain why or why not.
    Answer: Generally, DDL commands cannot be rolled back because they make immediate changes to the database structure, which are auto-committed in most systems.



#Maintaining a User Tracking Table:-

CREATE TABLE user_activity (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );

#Modifying a Existing Table Structure:-

ALTER TABLE user_activity
ADD COLUMN ip_address VARCHAR(15),
ADD COLUMN device VARCHAR(50);

#Renaming a Table and Column:-
RENAME TABLE user_activity TO user_logs;

ALTER TABLE user_logs
RENAME COLUMN action TO activity;

#Creating an Index for Performance Optimization:_

CREATE INDEX idx_user_logs_user_id
ON user_logs (user_id);
